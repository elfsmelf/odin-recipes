        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Lasagna, lasagna. How I love thee! It is possibly one of the most loved foods 
            in the whole wide world, and understandably so. There is just something 
            so sentimental about lasagna, so comforting. It evokes images of of gatherings 
            with family and friends all around the world. It is the sort of food that is 
            like a big warm hug, and so more-ish you want to keep digging in until you burst.
        </p>

        <h2>How to make Crispy Pea Fritters</h2>
<p>Here's how to make it. I love that the only thing you need to pull 
    out the cutting board for is to slice up some green onion!</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Batter first</strong> â€“ Put the flour, cornflour, egg, milk, 
    garlic powder, salt and pepper into a bowl and mix to combine.</li>
  <li><strong>Frozen peas</strong> â€“ Add the peas, still frozen, plus the 
    cheese and green onion. Then mix so the peas are coated in the batter. 
    It will look like there is not enough batter. Have faith â€“ the little there is sets when cooked and glues the peas together (the cheese helps too). <em>Too much batter = pancake situation = crispiness compromised = disappointing!</em></li>
  <li><strong>Pack to measure</strong> â€“ Scoop up the batter using 3 tablespoon 
    cookie scoop (# 20) or a 1/4 cup measure. Pack it in tightly.</li>
  <li><strong>Flatten</strong> â€“ Place / flick the batter into the pan.
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Flatten</strong> the mound to about 1.25cm / 0.5â€³ thick.</li>
      <li><strong>Flattened!</strong> Then repeat with remaining batter to make 
        4 or 5 at a time.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cook</strong> for about 1 1/2 minutes on each side until it 
    is deep golden and crispy. Adjust the heat as needed if it's browning 
    too quickly or slowly. And be brave â€“ make sure you cook until very golden, 
    because golden = crispy!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ðŸ’¡TIP:</strong> Don't skimp on oil for fritters. Heat enough oil 
    into your pan so the base is covered completely. Remember, oil thins out as it heats up so it will spread more. If you don't use enough oil, your fritters will end up burnt rather than golden and crispy which is so disappointing.</p>
<ol start="6">
  <li><strong>Drain</strong> the excess oil on paper towels then repeat with 
    remaining batter. You should get 9 or 10, depending on how tightly you pack 
    the cup. Then serve with the Lemon Yogurt Dipping Sauce! (Which is just a 
    mix together situation so I skipped the step photos for that.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Have these as a meal, serve as a starter, a hearty snack or for breakfast 
    with a runny egg.</p>
<p>Whatever time of the day it is, the moment you bite into the crispy golden 
    crust may be the best part of your day. And to think that all it took was
     a bag of frozen peas!! I love these sort of emergency recipes. Very handy
      when you need to eat, right now,
       without going to the store. <strong><em>â€“ Nagi x</em></strong></p>
